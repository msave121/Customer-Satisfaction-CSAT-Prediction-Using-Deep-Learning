# 📊 Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Prediction Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on predicting **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores** using a Deep Learning **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**. In the e-commerce domain, understanding customer sentiment from interactions and feedback plays a vital role in improving service quality, boosting customer retention, and driving business growth.

By leveraging advanced neural networks, this system forecasts CSAT scores based on interaction-level features, providing actionable insights that enable organizations to proactively enhance customer experience.

## 📖 Project Background

Customer satisfaction is a key performance indicator in e-commerce, directly impacting loyalty, repeat purchases, and brand reputation. Traditional approaches rely heavily on post-interaction surveys, which are often delayed and may fail to capture the complete customer journey.

With the advancement of deep learning, CSAT scores can now be predicted in near real-time using historical interaction data. This enables businesses to:

- Monitor service quality continuously  
- Detect dissatisfaction early  
- Identify operational bottlenecks  
- Improve agent performance  

This project applies ANN-based modeling to transform raw customer interaction data into meaningful satisfaction predictions.
